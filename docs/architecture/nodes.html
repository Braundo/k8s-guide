      <h1>Nodes</h1>
      <br><br>
      <h3>What are nodes?</h3>

- Worker machines in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Run containerized applications managed by the Control Plane.
- Equipped with a Kubelet agent that communicates with the master components.

<h3>Node Management</h3>

- Nodes are managed by master components, primarily the Control Plane.
- Operations include adding nodes, updating node software, and decommissioning nodes.

<h3>Node Name Uniqueness</h3>

- Each node must have a unique identifier within the cluster.
- Ensures accurate scheduling and task allocation.

<h3>Self-registration of Nodes</h3>

- Nodes can automatically register themselves upon joining the cluster.
- Facilitates dynamic scaling and resource allocation.

<h3>Manual Node Administration</h3>

- Admins can manually add or remove nodes using the Kubernetes API or CLI tools.
- Useful for fine-grained control over the cluster.

<h3>Node Status</h3>

- Provides detailed information about the node, including IP addresses, conditions (Ready, OutOfDisk, etc.), and resource capacity.
- Updated periodically by the node's Kubelet.

<h3>Node Heartbeats</h3>

- Regular signals sent from the Kubelet to the master to indicate the node's health.
- Failure to send a heartbeat within a certain time leads to node eviction.

<h3>Node Controller</h3>

- A Control Plane component responsible for monitoring nodes.
- Handles node failures and triggers pod evictions if necessary.

<h3>Rate Limits on Eviction</h3>

- Configurable settings that control the speed at which pods are evicted from unhealthy nodes.
- Helps to avoid overwhelming the remaining healthy nodes.

<h3>Resource Capacity Tracking</h3>

- Nodes report available resources like CPU, memory, and storage for better scheduling.
- Helps the scheduler in placing pods where resources are available.

<h3>Node Topology</h3>

- Information about the physical or virtual layout of nodes in terms of regions, zones, and other cloud-provider specific metadata.
- Used for optimizing workload distribution and high availability.

<h3>Graceful Node Shutdown</h3>

- A process that safely evicts pods before shutting down or rebooting a node.
- Ensures minimal impact on running applications and services.

<h3>Pod Priority based Graceful Node Shutdown</h3>

- During a graceful shutdown, pods with higher priority are evicted last.
- Ensures that critical applications continue to run for as long as possible.

<h3>Non-graceful Node Shutdown Handling

- In cases of abrupt failures, all pods are immediately terminated.
- Risks include data loss and potential service disruption.

<h3>Swap Memory Management

- Kubernetes allows for the enabling or disabling of swap memory usage on nodes.
- Swap usage can impact application performance and pod scheduling decisions.
